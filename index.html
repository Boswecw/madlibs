        A vacation is when you take a trip to some <span>(1 Adjective)</span> place
        with your <span>(2 Adjective)</span> family. Usually you go to some place
        that is near a/an <span>(3 Noun)</span> or up on a/an <span>(4 Noun)</span>.
        A good vacation place is one where you can ride <span>(5 Plural Noun)</span>
        or play <span>(6 Game)</span> or go hunting for <span>(7 Plural Noun)</span>. I like
        to spend my time <span>(8 Verb Ending In "ing")</span> or <span>(9 Verb Ending In "ing")</span>.
        When parents go on a vacation, they spend their time eating
        three <span>(10 Plural Noun)</span> a day, and fathers play golf, and mothers
        sit around <span>(11 Verb Ending In "ing")</span>. Last summer, my little brother
        fell in a/an <span>(12 Noun)</span> and got poison<span>(13 Plant)</span> all
        over his<span>(14 Part Of The Body)</span>. My family is going to go to <span>(15 A Place)</span>
        , and I will practice <span>(16 Verb Ending In "ing")</span>. Parents need vacations more than kids because parents are always very
        <span>(17 Adjective)</span> and because they have to work <span>(18 Number)</span>
        hours every day all year making enough <span>(19 Plural Noun)</span> to pay
        for the vacation.
