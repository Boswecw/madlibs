        A vacation is when you take a trip to some <span>(Adjective)</span> place
        with your <span>(Adjective)</span> family. Usually you go to some place
        that is near a/an <span>(Noun)</span> or up on a/an <span>(Noun)</span>.
        A good vacation place is one where you can ride <span>(Plural Noun)</span>
        or play <span>(Game)</span> or go hunting for <span>(Plural Noun</span>). I like
        to spend my time <span>(Verb Ending In "ing")</span> or <span>(Verb Ending In "ing")</span>.

        three <span>(Plural Noun)</span> a day, and fathers play golf, and mothers
        sit around <span>(Verb Ending In "ing")</span>. Last summer, my little brother
        fell in a/an <span>(Noun)</span> and got poison<span>(Plant)</span> all
        over his(Part Of The Body). My family is going to go to <span>(A Place)</span>
        , and I will practice <span>(Verb Ending In "ing")</span>. Parents need vacations more than kids because parents are always very
        <span>(Adjective)</span> and because they have to work <span>(Number)</span>
        hours every day all year making enough <span>(Plural Noun)</span> to pay
        for the vacation.
